Web Server Here - Alfred v2 Workflow
======

This workflow will take the focused/front Finder window and create a temporary Python Server at that location, using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

Function will also open the default web server URL (http://0.0.0.0:8000) in the default browser when the python server has started.

This is an extremely handy way to quickly test code in a server environment, especially when working with cross-domain functionality that will not work from localhost/local file server.

Borrows Terminal Finder functionality from Chris Yip's "Terminal Here" workflow: [chrisyip.im]
